# SWE_645
AWS Project for Student Services
This repsitory is created by Sameera Bammidi as part of class project during Spring 2017 semester.
This contains an MVC based web application for gathering survey data using JSF2.0 framework and PrimeFaces. As a part of this I consumed RESTful web services to support autocomplete fields on UI and implemented CRUD operations for the survey data using JPA, Hibernate, and Amazon RDS.
